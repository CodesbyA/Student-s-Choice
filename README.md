# How Virtual Reality is Transforming the Learning and Development Industry

What is VR in Learning and Development Industry and How it works: VR Training has been a big part of Learning and Development (L&D) for quite a while. Virtual Reality is being used in the L&D sphere to train people, particularly in high risk professions where there is much to be gained from practicing and honing skills in a safe and virtual world. The learning and development sector is seeing potential in VR as a tool for eLearning and Learning Management Systems. A user is given real life scenarios to work with and the user is given real time scores based on the result with AI and human intervention based on the circumstances. The future of augmented virtual reality application has gone far from its usual entertainment and gaming prospect. For example, the India-based Sankhya Infotech is able to produce VR eLearning content particularly for use in healthcare and aeronautical engineering. Businesses such as Kallidus in the UK also utilize VR technology for learning and training in which scalability and cost of the issues can be easily determined and addressed.

Despite the growing trend in VR applications for learning and development, the educational sector as a whole is still yet to reach a substantial capacity to support VR-based eLearning due to the cost and resources needed to build the technology to support the entire educational sector.

Virtual reality in the aforementioned applications uses Sims for medical science applications. Furthermore, public institutions such as the Homeland Security and LAPD are looking to utilize VR technology in conducting simulated disaster preparedness training courses.

VR can be used in any learning field such as Construction, Medical Sector, Universities, MNCs, and Retail Industries.

Some of the prime examples are:

# Construction: Hazard Identification, Fork Lift Training, Scaffolding Training.
VR training has been launched by companies such as 3M. The purpose of these training is to provide hands-on learning experience to users. This is beneficial as the time, resource and money taken to recreate these situations in real life is much more difficult..

The training includes:

Harness inspection: The user inspects the floating harness and checks for damages.
Working at heights awareness: The scenario is based in a high rise downtown where the user is tasked with picking up tools and attaching it to lanyard and walk on a walkway without a guardrail to look over the edge.

 Hazard Recognition: Trains up to dozens of employees at one time where trainees are challenged to explore photo-realistic 3D work spaces to identify and correct literally millions of randomized potential safety hazards. It has real-time scoring and analytics.

# Medical Sector: HumanSim provides training in Anesthesia, Sedation and Airway.
One of the VR applications launched in medical sector is HumanSim. HumanSim is a virtual trainer for administering emergency anesthesia and managing breathing.
The software was developed by Virtual Heroes for the Army's Telemedicine & Advanced Technology Research Center (TATRC), is available to the public.
It provides an immersive 3D training environment with an advanced physiology engine. The software allows physicians, nurses, medics, and other emergency personnel to practice Rapid Sequence Induction (RSI) and Moderate Sedation, techniques for quickly sedating and intubating critically injured patients. Trainees are challenged by ten separate scenarios, with patient complications such as airway trauma and multiple drug interactions, covering a very wide variety of patient situations.

# Universities: University of Alabama is currently training police officers using VR to react to "shoot, don't shoot" situations measuring brain waves during the training.

University of Alabama is currently researching  to learn how police officers react to 'shoot, don't shoot' situations by measuring brain waves during virtual reality police training.
 The researchers use mobile electroencephalogram, or EEG, amplifier to measure the brain activity of three law enforcement officers to determine which regions of the brain are active during simulations of potentially high-threat situations.
The researchers also measure the effectiveness of verbal commands used to de-escalate situations. They note the commands and the time as it relates to the EEG and rely on two seasoned officers to evaluate the responses and establish reliability.

# Strengths 

More options to choose from based on the requirement of the industry. 
Immersive Learning. 
Immediate Feedback. 
Be prepared for situations. 
Learn from mistakes. 
No risks. 

# Weakness

Cost. VR training such as VirtualSpeech can cost upwards of $300 for students.
Mild Nausea (Rating 3) in Construction VR.
Larger Space Requirement. 

# Conclusion

With VR, it’s easier to take your learners to any part of the world. Make them learn about other people’s experience, and how they can interact with their environment. VR is a technology that provides learners with a better and new way of learning.

In conclusion, now is the right time for instructors and L&D professionals to start introducing virtual reality into their blended learning. It’s becoming cheaper to employ, hence the need to start using it to better impact learning and development. Investing in virtual reality technology for L&D and businesses is a good move as it helps to deliver engaging and immersive learning experience.

                                          
# MNC's: Companies such as VirtualSpeech are providing VR training for Soft Skills.

The L&D market is beginning to open up to VR, with companies such as VirtualSpeech providing VR training for soft skills. They combine VR apps with Web VR and work with companies to integrate their corporate training into current LMS.
This makes training more accessible, cheaper, and increases learning retention levels by providing real time feedback and scores and highlighting the mistakes of the users and alternatives.
BP uses virtual reality to train their employees in start-up and emergency exit procedures at its oil refinery in Hull, England. and ExxonMobil is using VR for safety training. Users can put on a helmet and headphones, grab a controller, and plug into the virtual world, engaging multiple senses. They can turn their heads, walk around and watch the VR world react.

# Retail Industries: Walmart implemented a new staff VR trainer with a company called STRIVR.

Walmart developed a new staff VR trainer with a company called STRIVR.

Via their Occulus Rift Goggle headset, in the simulated real-world scenarios, staff will be presented with scenarios where they will need to make decisions by selecting specific options. They particularly use it for situations where it’s not that practical or cost effective to recreate in reality, such as finding and dealing with spills, preparing for a Black Friday shopping crush.

When staff face each scenario they will be asked awareness-building multiple choice-questions such as to explain what impact the spill could have on the store.
