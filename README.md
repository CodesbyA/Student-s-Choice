# How Virtual Reality is Transforming the Learning and Development Industry

What is VR in Learning and Development Industry and How it works
VR Training has been a big part of Learning and Development (L&D) for quite a while. Virtual Reality is being used in the L&D sphere to train people, particularly in high risk professions where there is much to be gained from practicing and honing skills in a safe and virtual world. A user is given real life scenarios to work with and the user is given real time scores based on the result with AI and human intervention based on the circumstances.
